A hungry Bridget bought 10 Gebaeck to snack on during her daily walk.
She was listening to Rammstein as she began her journey.
Walking to work in the city of Berlin.
Musik was her escape from the mundane hustle and bustle.
She hopped in in her Audi R8 and down the autobahn she flew!
On her way, she passed a biergarten that reminded her of brot.
Her Klimaanlage was blasting to keep her cool and refreshed.
Just ahead she saw it, her favorite Bratwurst shop!
She parked next to a BMW, and hopped out of her car.
When she walked up to the shop she noticed the Schloss was locked!
Saddened, she climbed back into her car and headed back down the Hauptstrasse.
Fortunately for her, on her way back, she noticed her local baeckerei was open! 
The baeckerei had klimaanlage so she relaxed and ate some brot.
